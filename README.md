# GOV.UK PaaS dashboard

> a ðŸ”¥ [firebreak](https://insidegovuk.blog.gov.uk/2018/05/03/firebreaks-on-gov-uk/) experiment using [Steampipe](https://steampipe.io/) to make a dashboard to monitor [GOV.UK PaaS](https://cloud.service.gov.uk) platform things.

# Overview

[Steampipe](https://steampipe.io) provides an sql layer on top of a [wide range of cloud platform services](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins) that have apis using a postgresql foreign data wrapper. 

This dashboard uses [steampipe.io](https://steampipe.io) to build a set of dashboards over [GOV.UK PaaS](https://cloud.service.gov.uk).

It uses the [CF CLI](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli) to access the API and list resources, 
the data is saved locally as csv files and accessed from a local steampipe dashboard running at http://localhost:9194
using a few plugins:
- [csv plugin](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/csv) 
- [cf plugin](https://github.com/SvenTo/steampipe-plugin-

The dashboards pull data from the underlying csv files using sql and render the results as a dashboard.

# How it works

using GNU make

1. logs into Cloud Foundry using the CF CLI `cf login --sso`
2. extracts data as csv format from the CF API `cf curl` converting JSON into CSV using csvkit
3. launches steampipe dashboard to render results locally accessing data from plugins, running SQL queries against the normalised data using postgresql


# Prerequisites

Assumes you are on a mac with homebrew installed with `/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"`

```
# homebrew packages
brew install cf-cli@8      # Cloud Foundry CLI
brew install gawk          # GNU awk
brew install gh            # GitHub CLI
brew install glow          # Glow CLI for markdown 
brew install gnu-sed       # GNU sed
brew install jq            # JSON wrangling tool
brew install steampipe     # make cloud apis queryble via SQL 
brew install yq            #Â YAML tools

# python tools
pip3 install csvkit        # csv wrangling tools
pip3 install visidata      # data wrangling swiss army penknife tool
```

a [GOV.UK PaaS account](https://cloud.service.gov.uk) with [global auditor](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/concepts/roles.html#permissions) permissions.

# Usage


`make dependencies` to install all the necessary packages

`make all` to login, extract data and run dashboard

`make dashboard` to run the dashboard with the current data and launch dashboard at http://localhost:9194

`make data` to work with the data

`make query` work with the data using a terminal interface

# GOV.UK PaaS dashboard

a ðŸ”¥ [firebreak](https://insidegovuk.blog.gov.uk/2018/05/03/firebreaks-on-gov-uk/) experiment using [Steampipe](https://steampipe.io/) to make a dashboard to monitor [GOV.UK PaaS](https://cloud.service.gov.uk) platform things.

Initially it runs locally but it will be deployed to the cloud at some point for the team to access. 

see [kanban](https://github.com/pauldougan/paas-steampipe-dashboard/projects/1) 

# Overview

![screenshot of the dashboard](docs/screenshot.png)

[Steampipe](https://steampipe.io) provides a SQL layer on top of a [wide range of cloud platform services](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins) that have apis using a postgresql [foreign data wrapper](https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-postgres-fdw). 

This dashboard uses [steampipe.io](https://steampipe.io) to build a set of dashboards over [GOV.UK PaaS](https://cloud.service.gov.uk).

It uses the [CF CLI](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli) to access the API and list resources, 
the data is saved locally as csv files and accessed from a local steampipe dashboard running at http://localhost:9194

it uses a number of plugins configured in [dashboards/mod.sp](dashboards/mod.sp)

The dashboards pull data from the underlying csv files using SQL and render the results as a dashboard.

# How it works

## 1. logs into Cloud Foundry using the CF CLI 

 `cf login --sso`

## 2. extracts data as csv format from the CF API 

`cf curl` converting JSON into CSV using csvkit's [in2csv](https://csvkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/scripts/in2csv.html)

## 3. launches steampipe dashboard

render results locally accessing data from plugins, running SQL queries against the normalised data using postgresql

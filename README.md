# PaaS dashboard

> a ðŸ”¥ [firebreak](https://insidegovuk.blog.gov.uk/2018/05/03/firebreaks-on-gov-uk/) experiment using [Steampipe](https://steampipe.io/) to make a dashboard to monitor [GOV.UK PaaS](https://cloud.service.gov.uk) platform things.

# Overview

[Steampipe](https://steampipe.io) provides an sql layer on top of a [wide range of cloud platform services](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins) that have apis. 
This dashboard uses the mechanics of steampipe to build a set of dashboards over GOV.UK PaaS.

It uses the [CF CLI](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli) and paas credentials to access the API and list resources, 
the data is saved locally as csv files and accessed from a local steampipe dashboard running at http://localhost:9194/local.dashboard.dashboard_paas
using the [csv plugin](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/csv) because there is no
plugin available for accessing the cf API.

The dashboards pull data from the underlying csv files using sql and render the results as a dashboard.
